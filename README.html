<h1>Skipti</h1>

<p>This is a small and very simple app that aims help parents and coaches keep track of the substitutions
and playing time in a game of chaos involving your small kids running around a football pitch (or other team games) where you're trying your best to keep track of whose on next, who has played too little, who has been playing a bit too long, and who was it that just came off?</p>

<p>The app is local storage only, meaning no calls to apis. And state is continuously stored
in the storage, meaning that it will never lose context if you accidentally navigate
away from the app and back again (or if your screen idles and turns off, which seems to be enough
for most apps nowadays to completely loose state and context leaving the user confused and annoyed).</p>

<p>The word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skipti">skipti</a> is from old norse, meaning change.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>

<p>This project is using the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>ClojureScript <br />
https://clojurescript.org/</li>
<li>Shadow CLJS <br />
https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs</li>
<li>Replicant - DOM rendering <br />
https://github.com/cjohansen/replicant</li>
<li>m1p - i18n <br />
https://github.com/cjohansen/m1p</li>
<li>phosphor-clj - <a href="https://phosphoricons.com/">Phosphor icons</a> provided as hiccup <br />
https://github.com/cjohansen/phosphor-clj/</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developing</h2>

<p>Start the development server</p>

<p><code>bash
npx shadow-cljs watch app
</code></p>

<p>Run the tests</p>

<p><code>
npx shadow-cljs watch test
</code></p>

<p>Or both at the same time</p>

<p><code>
npx shadow-cljs watch app test
</code></p>

<p>If you are using Emacs then just jack in cljs and both app and tests will run.
(the test output will be visible in the repl).</p>

<p>The app is then available at http://localhost:9090</p>
