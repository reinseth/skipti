# Skipti

This is a small and simple app with a single goal: help the coaches/parents keep track of the substitions
in a game of chaos involving your small kids running around a football pitch (or similar team games)
where you're trying your best to keep track of whose on next, who has played too little, who has
been playing a bit long, and who was it that just come off?

There are most likely lots of apps handling this in a much more better way than this, with
lots more features. But that's not the point. I needed just this, and I thought I'd have some
fun building it.

Oh, and there was another goal: make it offline only, and ensure that
the context is never lost when accidentally navigating away, turning your phone off,
or even just temporarily closing the screen. (Like for some reason all apps these days tend
to do. Lose context, that is.)

The word [skipti](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skipti) is from old norse, meaning change.
